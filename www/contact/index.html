	<h2>Contact</h2>
	<p><strong>E-Mail:</strong> Put my name together and at fastmail.nl after it.</p>
	<p><strong>Telephone nr:</strong> I have one, but I don't put it on the public facing internet. i like the harmony, peace and appropriate levels of silence.</p>
	<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> If you think I use this anymore you're not very observant.</p>
	<p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> I don't use this either anymore and I deleted my account because it declared its allegiance to an egregiously sinful cause by waving the symbol of a lifestyle which is extremely offensive to the virtue of chastity.</p>
	<p><strong>Twitter:</strong> Can I eat it?</p>
	<p><strong>My Home Address:</strong> My government doesn't permit me to use harsh words, pepperspray or flamethrowers in self defense, so unfortunately I can't put this out on the public facing internet.</p>
