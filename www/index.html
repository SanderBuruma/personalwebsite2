	<h1>Sander Buruma's personal website!</h1>  
	<h4>Now with additional random unsolicited thoughts.</h4>
	<p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is 360 cubits wide. The sun is 432,000 miles in radius, the moon 216,000 miles in diameter. The speed of light is almost exactly 432 * 432 in miles per second. The second should be defined as the time it takes for a pendulum 1 meter long to swing one way. 1 meter should be defined as 1 / 40 millionth the earth's circumference.</p>
	<h2>The idea of the minimalistic website</h2>
	<p>This website is intended to be minimalistic. A minimalistic website is meant to stay very small and very simple, similar to how Luke Smith describes it on YouTube.</p>
	<p>A simple website is a website which is easily loaded on any device anywhere because it is small. In addition any device can display it because it only uses html/css and nothing fancy. As it stands today many websites cannot function efficiently for people in developing nations without access to fast internet plus the latest smartphones and laptops. This should not be the case. The majority of the internet should be easily usable by more than 95% of the world's population; hence minimalism.</p>
	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm a Software Engineer and 2.08 meters (6'8") tall. My favourite unit of measurement is the cubit. The cubit is 1 / 10 millionth of the radius of the Earth. In cubits I'm 3.2 cubits tall. I grew up on street number 32. The center of the temple of Babylon is at latitude 32 degrees, 32 arc minutes, 32 arc seconds.</p>
	<p>I was trained as a medical lab technician but now I work as a Fullstack Developer, having taught myself over YT and internet and having taken a 3 month developers bootcamp.</p>
	<p>I have a girlfriend, and as most boyfriends and husbands will know one should be careful with what they say about them in public. So I should say that she's the prettiest in the world above all others. But more important than that she's a faithful Catholic.</p>
	<h2>Contact</h2>
	<p><strong>E-Mail:</strong> Put my name together and at fastmail.nl after it.</p>
	<p><strong>Telephone nr:</strong> I have one, but I don't put it on the public facing internet. i like the harmony, peace and appropriate levels of silence.</p>
	<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> If you think I use this anymore you're not very observant.</p>
	<p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> I don't use this either anymore and I deleted my account because it declared its allegiance to an egregiously sinful cause by waving the symbol of a lifestyle which is extremely offensive to the virtue of chastity.</p>
	<p><strong>My Home Address:</strong> My government doesn't permit me to use harsh words, pepperspray or flamethrowers in self defense, so unfortunately I can't put this out on the public facing internet. But if you do look me up I'll offer you a nice glass of water.</p>
